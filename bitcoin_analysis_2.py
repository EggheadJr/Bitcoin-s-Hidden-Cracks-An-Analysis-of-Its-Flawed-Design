        "1. 21 Million Cap:",
        "   - The decision to cap Bitcoin at 21 million coins is solely Satoshi Nakamoto's choice. "
        "There is no mathematical or analytical basis for this number; it was a design decision "
        "without specific justification.",
        
        "2. Unequal Rewards:",
        "   - Early miners received 50 BTC per block, while current miners receive only 6.25 BTC per block. "
        "This represents an 87.5% reduction in rewards compared to the initial mining period, leading to "
        "significant unfairness in wealth distribution.",
        
        "3. Unfair Coin Allocation:",
        "   - The allocation of coins to various wallets in the early stages was arbitrary and has contributed "
        "to an unequal distribution of wealth. Many early coins remain unspent, which further skews the fairness of the system.",
        
        "4. Money Creation from Mining:",
        "   - Miners create new Bitcoin as rewards for validating transactions, effectively generating money out of thin air. "
        "This process does not have a physical backing, similar to how traditional currencies might be supported by gold or other assets.",
        "   - While miners incur costs for electricity and computing power, the amount of Bitcoin awarded does not directly "
        "correspond to these expenses. There is no guaranteed compensation for the resources used, and the value of the newly created coins is not necessarily justified by the costs of mining.",
        
        "5. Potential for Exploitation:",
        "   - The system is vulnerable to manipulation. With sufficient computational power, an entity could execute a 51% attack, "
        "where a miner or group of miners controls more than half of the network's hashing power. This would allow them to validate fraudulent transactions, create double spending, and dislodge the existing blockchain.",
        "   - In a successful 51% attack, the attacker would gain temporary control over the blockchain by creating a longer chain than the honest nodes. Here’s a breakdown of what would happen, step by step:",
        
        "   #### 1. Setting Up the Attack: Creating a Parallel Chain",
        "   - Starting Point: The attacker makes a legitimate transaction on the public Bitcoin network.",
        "   - Building a Secret Chain: Simultaneously, the attacker mines a private chain that excludes this transaction.",
        
        "   #### 2. Mining the Private Chain Faster Than Honest Nodes",
        "   - The attacker mines blocks in their private chain faster than honest nodes can mine on the public chain.",
        
        "   #### 3. Double-Spend Attempt: Revealing the Private Chain",
        "   - After mining enough blocks on the private chain, the attacker broadcasts it to the network, "
        "and nodes switch to the longest chain.",
        
        "   #### 4. Transaction Reversal",
        "   - The initial transaction does not exist on the attacker’s chain, allowing them to double-spend the same Bitcoins.",
        
        "   #### 5. Visual and Structural Changes",
        "   - Before the Attack: One linear chain shared by all nodes.",
        "   - During the Attack: Two branches—public and private.",
        "   - After the Attack: The attacker’s chain becomes the longest, invalidating the honest transactions.",
        
        "   #### 6. Implications and Aftermath",
        "   - Network Shock: Users may experience confusion and financial losses.",
        "   - Defensive Mechanisms: Nodes may refuse long reorganizations, leading to further forking.",
        "   - Damage to Confidence: Users may lose trust in Bitcoin's security.",
        
        "### Summary of 'Benefit' to the Attacker",
        "   - Direct Financial Gain: The attacker can double-spend their Bitcoins.",
        "   - Destabilization: The attack undermines trust in the network.",
        
        "### Conclusion",
        "This breakdown outlines the cycle of a 51% attack from initiation to execution and its structural impacts on the blockchain."
